Challenges:

1) Laureates with multiple prizes (3 people) - had to implement counting and grouping in order to make sure their second prize is shown

2) Motivation had some unreadable symbols like tags <>, special characters etc. Needed to decode it so it displays in a readable format

3) Authors of literature had their art without quotation marks (it was replaced when did another task) so had to make sure their art displays in  ' ' single quotation marks

4) Hemingway's art  when displayed was displayed like this:

...The Old Man and the Sea,' and...

 I moved comma after the single quotation mark so it displays like this: 

...The Old Man and the Sea', and...

4) Some laureates had mistakes in motivation like ' , (quote-comma) , had to change to , ' (comma-quote) format.
